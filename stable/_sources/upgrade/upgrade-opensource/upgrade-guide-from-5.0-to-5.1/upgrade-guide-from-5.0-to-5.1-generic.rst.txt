Upgrade Guide - |SCYLLA_NAME| |SRC_VERSION| to |NEW_VERSION|
=============================================================================

This document is a step by step procedure for upgrading from |SCYLLA_NAME| |SRC_VERSION| to |SCYLLA_NAME| |NEW_VERSION|, and rollback to version |SRC_VERSION| if required.

This guide covers upgrading Scylla on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7/8, CentOS 7/8, Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20.04. It also applies when using ScyllaDB official image on EC2, GCP, or Azure; the image is based on Ubuntu 20.04.

See :doc:`OS Support by Platform and Version </getting-started/os-support>` for information about supported versions.

Upgrade Procedure
=================

A ScyllaDB upgrade is a rolling procedure which does **not** require full cluster shutdown.
For each of the nodes in the cluster, serially (i.e. one node at a time), you will:

* Check that the cluster's schema is synchronized
* Drain the node and backup the data
* Backup the configuration file
* Stop ScyllaDB
* Download and install new ScyllaDB packages
* Start ScyllaDB
* Validate that the upgrade was successful

Apply the following procedure **serially** on each node. Do not move to the next node before validating that the node you upgraded is up and running the new version.

**During** the rolling upgrade, it is highly recommended:

* Not to use the new |NEW_VERSION| features
* Not to run administration functions, like repairs, refresh, rebuild or add or remove nodes. See `sctool <https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/sctool/>`_ for suspending ScyllaDB Manager (only available for ScyllaDB Enterprise) scheduled or running repairs.
* Not to apply schema changes

.. note:: Before upgrading, make sure to use the latest `ScyllaDB Monitoring <https://monitoring.docs.scylladb.com/>`_ stack.

Upgrade Steps
=============
Check the cluster schema
-------------------------
Make sure that all nodes have the schema synchronized before upgrade. The upgrade procedure will fail if there is a schema disagreement between nodes.

.. code:: sh

   nodetool describecluster

Drain the nodes and backup the data
-----------------------------------
Before any major procedure, like an upgrade, it is recommended to backup all the data to an external device. In Scylla, backup is done using the ``nodetool snapshot`` command. For **each** node in the cluster, run the following command:

.. code:: sh

   nodetool drain
   nodetool snapshot

Take note of the directory name that nodetool gives you, and copy all the directories having that name under ``/var/lib/scylla`` to a backup device.

When the upgrade is completed on all nodes, remove the snapshot with the ``nodetool clearsnapshot -t <snapshot>`` command to prevent running out of space.

Backup the configuration file
------------------------------
.. code:: sh

   sudo cp -a /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml.backup-src

Gracefully stop the node
------------------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo service scylla-server stop

Download and install the new release
------------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

        Before upgrading, check what version you are running now using ``dpkg -s scylla-server``. You should use the same version as this version in case you want to |ROLLBACK|_ the upgrade. If you are not running a |SRC_VERSION|.x version, stop right here! This guide only covers |SRC_VERSION|.x to |NEW_VERSION|.y upgrades.

        **To upgrade ScyllaDB:**

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_DEB_NEW_REPO| to |NEW_VERSION|.

        #. Install the new ScyllaDB version:

            .. code-block:: console

               sudo apt-get clean all
               sudo apt-get update
               sudo apt-get dist-upgrade scylla


        Answer ‘y’ to the first two questions.

   .. group-tab:: RHEL/CentOS

        Before upgrading, check what version you are running now using ``rpm -qa | grep scylla-server``. You should use the same version as this version in case you want to |ROLLBACK|_ the upgrade. If you are not running a |SRC_VERSION|.x version, stop right here! This guide only covers |SRC_VERSION|.x to |NEW_VERSION|.y upgrades.

        **To upgrade ScyllaDB:**

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_RPM_NEW_REPO|_  to |NEW_VERSION|.
        #. Install the new ScyllaDB version:

            .. code:: sh

               sudo yum clean all
               sudo yum update scylla\* -y

   .. group-tab:: EC2/GCP/Azure Ubuntu Image

        Before upgrading, check what version you are running now using ``dpkg -s scylla-server``. You should use the same version as this version in case you want to |ROLLBACK|_ the upgrade. If you are not running a |SRC_VERSION|.x version, stop right here! This guide only covers |SRC_VERSION|.x to |NEW_VERSION|.y upgrades.

        There are two alternative upgrade procedures:

        * :ref:`Upgrading ScyllaDB and simultaneously updating 3rd party and OS packages <upgrade-image-recommended-procedure>`. It is recommended if you are running a ScyllaDB official image (EC2 AMI, GCP, and Azure images), which is based on Ubuntu 20.04.

        * :ref:`Upgrading ScyllaDB without updating any external packages <upgrade-image-upgrade-guide-regular-procedure>`.

        .. _upgrade-image-recommended-procedure:

        **To upgrade ScyllaDB and update 3rd party and OS packages (RECOMMENDED):**

        Choosing this upgrade procedure allows you to upgrade your ScyllaDB version and update the 3rd party and OS packages using one command.

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_DEB_NEW_REPO| to |NEW_VERSION|.

        #. Load the new repo:

            .. code:: sh

               sudo apt-get update


        #. Run the following command to update the manifest file:

            .. code:: sh

               cat scylla-packages-<version>-<arch>.txt | sudo xargs -n1 apt-get install -y

            Where:

              * ``<version>`` - The ScyllaDB version to which you are upgrading ( |NEW_VERSION| ).
              * ``<arch>`` - Architecture type: ``x86_64`` or ``aarch64``.

            The file is included in the ScyllaDB packages downloaded in the previous step. The file location is ``http://downloads.scylladb.com/downloads/scylla/aws/manifest/scylla-packages-<version>-<arch>.txt``

            Example:

                .. code:: sh

                   cat scylla-packages-5.1.2-x86_64.txt | sudo xargs -n1 apt-get install -y

                .. note::

                   Alternatively, you can update the manifest file with the following command:

                   ``sudo apt-get install $(awk '{print $1'} scylla-packages-<version>-<arch>.txt) -y``

        .. _upgrade-image-upgrade-guide-regular-procedure:

        **To upgrade ScyllaDB:**

        #. Update the |SCYLLA_DEB_NEW_REPO| to |NEW_VERSION|.

        #. Install the new ScyllaDB version:

            .. code-block:: console

               sudo apt-get clean all
               sudo apt-get update
               sudo apt-get dist-upgrade scylla


        Answer ‘y’ to the first two questions.


Start the node
--------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo service scylla-server start

Validate
--------
#. Check cluster status with ``nodetool status`` and make sure **all** nodes, including the one you just upgraded, are in ``UN`` status.
#. Use ``curl -X GET "http://localhost:10000/storage_service/scylla_release_version"`` to check the ScyllaDB version. Validate that the version matches the one you upgraded to.
#. Check scylla-server log (by ``journalctl _COMM=scylla``) and ``/var/log/syslog`` to validate there are no new errors in the log.
#. Check again after two minutes, to validate no new issues are introduced.

Once you are sure the node upgrade was successful, move to the next node in the cluster.

See |Scylla_METRICS|_ for more information.

Update the Mode in perftune.yaml
------------------------------------
Due to performance improvements in version 5.1, your cluster's existing nodes may use a different mode than 
the nodes created after the upgrade. Using different modes across one cluster is not recommended, so you 
should ensure that the same mode is used on all nodes. See 
:doc:`Updating the Mode in perftune.yaml After a ScyllaDB Upgrade</kb/perftune-modes-sync>` for instructions.


Rollback Procedure
==================

.. include:: /upgrade/_common/warning_rollback.rst

The following procedure describes a rollback from |SCYLLA_NAME| |NEW_VERSION|.x to |SRC_VERSION|.y. Apply this procedure if an upgrade from |SRC_VERSION| to |NEW_VERSION| failed before completing on all nodes. Use this procedure only for nodes you upgraded to |NEW_VERSION|.

ScyllaDB rollback is a rolling procedure which does **not** require full cluster shutdown.
For each of the nodes you rollback to |SRC_VERSION|, serially (i.e. one node at a time), you will:

* Drain the node and stop Scylla
* Retrieve the old ScyllaDB packages
* Restore the configuration file
* Restore system tables
* Reload systemd configuration
* Restart ScyllaDB
* Validate the rollback success

Apply the following procedure **serially** on each node. Do not move to the next node before validating that the rollback was successful and the node is up and running the old version.

Rollback Steps
==============
Drain and gracefully stop the node
----------------------------------

.. code:: sh

   nodetool drain
   sudo service scylla-server stop

Download and install the old release
------------------------------------

        #. Install:

            .. code-block::

               sudo apt-get update
               sudo apt-get remove scylla\* -y
               sudo apt-get install scylla

        Answer ‘y’ to the first two questions.

Restore the configuration file
------------------------------
.. code:: sh

   sudo rm -rf /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml
   sudo cp -a /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml.backup-src | /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml

Restore system tables
---------------------

Restore all tables of **system** and **system_schema** from the previous snapshot because |NEW_VERSION| uses a different set of system tables. See :doc:`Restore from a Backup and Incremental Backup </operating-scylla/procedures/backup-restore/restore/>` for reference.

.. code:: sh

    cd /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/snapshots/<snapshot_name>/
    sudo cp -r * /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/
    sudo chown -R scylla:scylla /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/

Reload systemd configuration
----------------------------

You must reload the unit file if the systemd unit file is changed.

.. code:: sh

   sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start the node
--------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo service scylla-server start

Validate
--------
Check the upgrade instructions above for validation. Once you are sure the node rollback is successful, move to the next node in the cluster.
